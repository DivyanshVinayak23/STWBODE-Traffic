# STWBODE-Traffic
In this paper, we introduce a new idea to enhance the traffic prediction method
by executing and comparing the node generation methods such
as random walk, DeepWalk, and Node2Vec using performance
metrics. Nodes are converted into time series data and are used
to construct adjacency matrices, which are processed by a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial dependencies.
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network then models tem-
poral dependencies
